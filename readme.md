# Khefford.io Portfolio Website  


## Purpose

The Purpose of this Portfolio Website is to showcase my best work, what services I offer, and my experience to my target audience being a potential employer or client. This Portfolio Website will further demonstrate my capability to be an asset to a company or client in the case of freelancing services.  


## Functionality & Features  

There are a multitude of Design, Functionality, and Features which contribute to the overall aesthetic of the website.

### Inspirations  

The main inspiration for my portfolio website design and structure is from the Sydney University website.  
Their design is simplistic, modern and provides ease of access.  

The Navigation bar made it very easy to navigate the website as the links were neat, simple bestowing a clean and artful website. Using their website as inpiration I was able to create my own design.

### Website Theme and Design

#### Title Domain 

I chose to name the website "khefford.io" as most tech start ups are using .io for their domain name; io meaning input/output. As I plan to also freelance, I wanted to make the name itself demonstrate modern technology references.

#### Colour Scheme and Font

There were three main colours that I used for this website to brighten the website and engage and guide the audience to the navigation and important links.
